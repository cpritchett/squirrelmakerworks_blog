Unfortunately I didn't take a picture of the final product, so I'm not going to do that infuriating thing of posting a similar stock photo of something that isn't even plant-based (ala what VegNews [got busted for](https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/blogpost/post/veg-news-the-vegan-magazine-filled-with-meat-photos/2011/04/15/AFaeDwjD_blog.html) a few years back).  Instead, here's a neat photo of corn.

Ricos (yes, the canned nacho cheese) featured [a recipe](https://ricos.com/mexican-street-corn-queso/) on their site for something I thought my kids might actually eat:  Mexican Street Corn Queso.  The photo included _over there_ looks great, go check it out.  I needed to veganize it though.  This was my attempt, based on the the Nacho Cheese recipe from [The Hidden Veggies](https://thehiddenveggies.com/vegan-nacho-cheese-sauce-cheddar-style/) but with a more "whatever I have in my pantry" flair due to COVID-19.

*Ingredients:*

_For Cheese Sauce_
* 1 1/2 cups cold soy milk
* 1/2 cup nutritional yeast
* 1 tbps corn starch
* 1 tbps tapioca starch (I actually used Ener-G egg replacer here)
* dash of tumeric (or more depending on how yellow you want this)

_Everything Else_
* 1 bag of frozen corn
* 2 tbps olive oil
* 2 garlic cloves, minced
* 1 tbps chili powder
* 1 tsp salt
* chopped cilantro (unless you think it tastes like soap)

*Instructions*

1.  Add cold milk and all of cheese sauce ingrediants to a pan over medium heat.  Whisk until thickened.  Note that tumeric is not flavorless, so you may have to balance the taste vs. how yellow you want the final product to be.  Set aside. 
2.  In a skillet over medium heat, add olive oil and frozen corn and saute until the corn is thawed and slightly charred. 
3.  Add garlic, chili powder, and salt and saute for a couple of minutes until the garlic is browned but not burned.  
4.  Turn off heat and add cheese sauce to corn mixture.  Garnish with cilantro and serve.
