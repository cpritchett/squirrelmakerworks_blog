Social distancing due to COVID-19 has been especially hard on my kids.  Mainly because they are much more extraverted then I ever was.  This is honestly a more extravegant purchase that I would generally care to make, but they needed a way to get out a lot of pent up energy at home.  So enter the bounce house.  They jump, my wife and I keep some sanity.  It mostly works.  Except on the days when they "really want to jump" and decide they are done after 5 minutes.
