I'm Chad Pritchett, and this is my blog.  I'm a Cloud Engineer and this is where I post technical projects, woodworking, scale models, or pictures my kids have drawn. Any views expressed are my own and are not of my employer.  All information is provided for education and illustrative purposes only.
