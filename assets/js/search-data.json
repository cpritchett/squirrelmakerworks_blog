Instead, here’s a neat photo of corn. . . unsplash-logo . Charles Deluvio . Ricos (yes, the canned nacho cheese) featured a recipe on their site for something I thought my kids might actually eat: Mexican Street Corn Queso. The photo included over there looks great, go check it out. I needed to veganize it though. This was my attempt, based on the the Nacho Cheese recipe from The Hidden Veggies but with a more “whatever I have in my pantry” flair due to COVID-19. . Ingredients: . For Cheese Sauce . 1 1/2 cups cold soy milk | 1/2 cup nutritional yeast | 1 tbps corn starch | 1 tbps tapioca starch (I actually used Ener-G egg replacer here) | dash of tumeric (or more depending on how yellow you want this) | . Everything Else . 1 bag of frozen corn | 2 tbps olive oil | 2 garlic cloves, minced | 1 tbps chili powder | 1 tsp salt | chopped cilantro (unless you think it tastes like soap) | . Instructions . Add cold milk and all of cheese sauce ingrediants to a pan over medium heat. Whisk until thickened. Note that tumeric is not flavorless, so you may have to balance the taste vs. how yellow you want the final product to be. Set aside. | In a skillet over medium heat, add olive oil and frozen corn and saute until the corn is thawed and slightly charred. | Add garlic, chili powder, and salt and saute for a couple of minutes until the garlic is browned but not burned. | Turn off heat and add cheese sauce to corn mixture. Garnish with cilantro and serve. |",

This is honestly a more extravegant purchase that I would generally care to make, but they needed a way to get out a lot of pent up energy at home. So enter the bounce house. They jump, my wife and I keep some sanity. It mostly works. Except on the days when they “really want to jump” and decide they are done after 5 minutes. .",

With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master - badges: true - comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon. More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts .
